 King Charles III was crowned Britain’s 40th reigning monarch since 1066 alongside Camilla, the Queen Consort, at Westminster Abbey in London . The King opted for a smaller, shorter and more diverse ceremony than the previous coronation held for his mother in 1953. This decision led to some people with Nigerian roots playing significant roles during the King’s coronation. On a day of splendour and formality, featuring customs dating back more than 1,000 years, here are six Nigerians who took part in King Charles’s coronation. <img data-lazy-fallback="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" width="326" height="326" class="lazyload" data-src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/j1a4IkuiAoRy8CYddOMk7IL6Mm9AaogbfulJRJ7F9wQG_Et_7L3UQR9VH1lRkrCeT1Tn93eeSkDIxP2gWt3ilgB9UlvePt3SYVzNEe5sjTWH2aUR1M4ztZ-oti3V-_7c9EcU-vt9IED2Ls7Mg9l4K1Y" /> Dame Elizabeth Anionwu was part of the Royal procession at King Charles’s coronation.
