 Nigeria’s equities market started the new month of May on a negative note, declining by 0.20 percent at the close of trading session on Tuesday, the first trading day of the week. Analysts at Lagos-based Meristem research said they expect positive mood to be sustained this week “hinged on profitable opportunities on key tickers prices in relation to our valuation targets”.
The analysts noted that system liquidity is high “and this poses an opportunity for the flow of funds into the equity market.
“We however note that this preview can be hindered by profit-taking actions on bellwether tickers, which typically call the shots in the market. Overall, we anticipate the All-Share Index to record gains this week”. Femi Otedola’s Geregu Power led the league of laggards after its share price moved down from preceding day high of N323 to N290.70, down by N32.30 or 10percent.
