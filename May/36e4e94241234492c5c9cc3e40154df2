 The Rose Hospital was in a state of confusion on this particular day. The number of patients wheeled in for various accident related cases was quite high. Everyone was on their toes attending to different people. Nurses running around to meet with instructions given by doctors. It was surely one of those busy days. It felt like another season of Grey’s Anatomy. Babatunde Badmus and his wife were among those that were rushed in. Babatunde had a compound fracture from a severe car accident that put his right leg in a dicey state. His wife was rushed to the emergency unit. As they wheeled her there, though in pain, he kept shouting “Please help save my wife, save her life …please!!”. The nurses were doing their best to calm him down “Not to worry sir, she will be fine, we urgently need to attend to you too, the fracture you sustained is severe” Nurse Kike told him. She was one of the nurses wheeling him to the emergency room.

Babatunde required urgent surgery to clean the area of the injury because there was a deep cut into the skin and the bone on the leg was out, the doctors feared debris and infection could travel to the fractured location, and lead to a high rate of infection in the bone. The doctors were glad he was rushed in not long after the accident happened. Dr Mike Raymond conducted a physical examination and asked him questions about how and where the injury occurred. Though Babatunde was in pain, he managed to explain what happened. The wound was thoroughly examined to determine the extent of the damage. The Doctor ordered an x-ray to get a better look at the bone.
