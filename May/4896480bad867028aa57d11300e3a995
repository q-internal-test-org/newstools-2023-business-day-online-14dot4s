Moment fulfills our strategy to expand our ecosystem by investing in adjacent businesses that provide scalable services, underpinned by technology,” Mawela said. Similarly, the pan-Africa fintech aims at catering to the needs of the continent’s 44 million small businesses. By reducing reliance on cash payments, MultiChoice aims to make digital transactions more accessible to the 350 million underbanked or unbanked consumers in Africa. MultiChoice is particularly keen on driving the adoption of South Africa’s PayShap and similar real-time payment methods. Furthermore, the company plans to provide a platform for global African trade, enabling importers and exporters to have virtual accounts in over 40 currencies while facilitating local payments in more than 130 countries.
