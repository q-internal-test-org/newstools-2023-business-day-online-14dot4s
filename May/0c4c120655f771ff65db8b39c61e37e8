 Ngozi Dozie, co-founder of Nigerian-based digital bank, Carbon, has apologised to customers for the difficulty they have faced struggling to conduct transactions on the platform. The company said the glitches have been resolved. The four days of downtime disrupted transaction activities for thousands of customers who took to social media platforms like Twitter to express their disappointment at the turn of events. “We failed at the most basic of banking services and we offer our unreserved apologies. We have spoken to many of you and know that the impact was severe; school fees missed, delayed healthcare bills, gifts for loved ones and essential payments on food and transport. It was especially difficult for all after the cash shortages suffered by many during this year,” Dozie said.

In the case of Carbon, customers have also acknowledged the company’s efforts to constantly update with information on how they are resolving the problems. “Carbon is experiencing one of the worst interbank transfer downtimes I’ve ever seen, and one of the reasons it hasn’t blown up into a crisis is because their comms has been impeccable,” said David Adeleke, Africa editor for Rest of the World. “Customers are basically getting an overdose of update emails. I salute them.”
