 Justice Haruna Tsammani, presiding judge at the  Presidential Election Petition Tribunal, has adjourned till May 22, the pre-hearing of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Atiku Abubakar’s petition against Tinubu till May 22. The parties in the case are yet to agree and harmonise proposed schedule for the main hearing. They are also yet to agree on the number of witnesses that will testify, the time to be allocated, and time for examination and cross-examination of witnesses. The petitioners and first respondents (INEC) have met and agreed on number of witness and time allocation.  Chris Uche counsel to Atiku said the party intends to call not more than 100 witnesses. However, counsel to APC, and counsel to Tinubu said they were not privy to the meeting between the petitioners and the first respondent, hence they have some issues they are yet to agree on. Therfore, the adjournment is to allow them time to do so.
