 Elon Musk, the chief executive officer of Twitter has announced a new CEO of the microblogging platform. Musk made this public on his official Twitter handle on 11 May 2023, stating that the new CEO will resume in six weeks while he takes over as executive chairman and CTO of the company. “Excited to announce that I’ve hired a new CEO for X/Twitter. She will be starting in 6 weeks. “My role will transition to being exec chair & CTO, overseeing product, software & sysops,” he tweeted. In December 2022, users of the microblogging platform voted against the owner Musk as the CEO in an unscientific poll he organised and promised to honour, just weeks after he took charge of the social media giant.

Over the months, Musk has succeeded in sacking half of Twitter’s staff, readmitting far-right figures to the platform, suspending journalists and charging for previously free services and account verification. Twitter changes under Musk as CEO After taking over the platform, Musk announced it would charge $8 per month to verify account holders’ identities which he has recently commenced. As the CEO of the microblogging platform, Musk significantly changed Twitter’s policies and features, which has led to several major advertisers pausing spending on the social network. Musk started the purchase of Twitter blue tick that allows users to buy verification and recently got rid of old “legacy” verified check marks. The platform has also disbanded its Trust and Safety council and reinstated the accounts of previously banned users, including former president Donald Trump and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, among others.
