 One of the aspirants of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the direct primary election held in Kogi State on April 14, 2023, Shaibu Abubakar Audu, has withdrawn the lawsuit he instituted against the party and the winner of the primary, Usman Ododo. Audu, who is the son of late former Governor Abubakar Audu, recently disclosed that his decision to withdraw the case was in the interest of the party during his visit to Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello in Abuja. He said this just as Sanusi Ohiare, the immediate past executive director of the Rural Electrification Agency and governorship aspirant on the platform of the APC, jointly declared support for Ododo Ahmed Usman, APC gubernatorial candidate.

Further, Audu commended Governor Bello for his ingenuity and leadership in galvanising the party structure for unprecedented success in Kogi State and assured the governor that their collective efforts would guarantee Ododo’s victory. Governor Bello, in turn, commended Audu for his sportsmanship, emphasising that the APC in Kogi State had always been united, the reason for the party’s electoral success in the state. He added that his administration had gained the trust of Kogi residents and that there would be no need to switch allegiance. During his brief remarks, Ododo Ahmed Usman, expressed his confidence in the party’s unity. “For us, politics is not a do or die affair. Alh. Ododo has won the primary and I will give him my full support. My dad was one of the founding fathers of the APC, we won’t do anything to jeopardise the chances of our own party,” Ohiare said.
