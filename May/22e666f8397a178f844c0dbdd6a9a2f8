 A political group, in the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ondo state, the Sunshine Movement, has called for the removal of the APC chairman in the state, Ade Adetimehin over his alleged poor handling of party affairs and gross incompetence. A statement by the chairman of the Sunshine Movement, Adewole Ifedayo, made available to journalists on Monday in Akure said Adetimehin has lost all sense of modicum to still function as the state chairman of the party. Ifedayo said; “He has hijacked the whole party machinery and turned it into his personal business. He sits in his comfort zone with few renegades within the party to make decisions for us” “It has got to a point where we couldn’t take it anymore,” he said. We have passed a vote of no confidence on Adetimehin over his high- handedness “Adetimehin has placed selfish, group and sectional interests over and above the general interests of the party.

He has been reduced to a mere tax collector who gives party ticket to highest bidder. He has jettisoned meritocracy and now celebrates mediocrity. “The resilience of party members won the election for our President Elect. The State Chairman is not a democrat going by his actions and we say he is not a fit and proper person to head a big party like the All Progressives Congress in Ondo State. “The All Progressives Congress under his watch has been hopelessly mismanaged. Members of the party are unjustly treated and not fairly rewarded.” As at the time of filing this report, all efforts to get reaction of the party chairman to the allegations proved abortive as calls put across to him were not answered.
