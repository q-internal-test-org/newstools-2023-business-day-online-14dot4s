 A Federal High Court in Awka has issued a bench warrant directed to the Nigeria Police to effect the arrest of Augustine Ike also known as Ikedoji, a House of Assembly Member Elect representing Nnewi North Constituency. Also, another Onyedika Chukwuma was also found wanting, as the warrant requested for them to be brought before the court for arraignment. The warrant was particularly directed to the Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba. Justice F.O Riman gave the order following what the court described as their refusal to be served with the Charge against them by Baba. The court noted that since the 29th day of March 2023 when the police completed their investigation on Ike and Chukwuma and were indicted, the duo has refused to show up and they have been on the run. The development has made it difficult for the Court to serve them with the charge against them. The Court further stated that it will not assume jurisdiction to start hearing the charge unless they are served and that the only option left is for the Court to issue a bench warrant to the IGP to effect their arrest.
