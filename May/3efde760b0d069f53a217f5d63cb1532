 Ovie Omo-Agege, the deputy president of the Senate, has vowed to retrieve his stolen mandate from the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Sheriff Oborevwori, hammering that he won the election clean and clear. Omo-Agege made the vow on Wednesday while granting an audience to his constituents from Delta Central, Ndokwa over the facilitation of the Federal University of Medical and Health Sciences in Kwale community. He said he is determined to fight to retrieve his mandate all the way because the real valid votes scored by him in the election, are more than enough to declare him as the governor-elect. According to him, the result declared by INEC, was a ruse that cannot stand the test of litigation.
