 Governor Hope Uzodinma of Imo State, his counterpart in Kogi, Yahaya Bello and some other governors elected on the platform of All Progressives Congress (APC) are presently having a closed-door meeting with the leadership of the party. The governors, who arrived Abuja around 5:20 pm on Wednesday evening, went straight into the secretariat for the crucial meeting with the National Chairman of the party, Abdullahi Adamu and members of the National Working Committee. Although the agenda for the meeting was not made public, sources within the secretariat told our correspondent that it must have one or two things to do with addressing the internal wrangling within the party and the contentious zoning arrangements for the leadership of the 10th National Assembly as well.
