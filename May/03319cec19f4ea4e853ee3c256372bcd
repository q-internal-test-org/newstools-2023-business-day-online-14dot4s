 Daniel Bwala, spokesman of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) presidential campaign council, has advanced reasons why Godswill Akpabio would not be elected as Senate president. Bwala stated this in a tweet on Monday morning via his Twitter handle. Akpabio, a former governor of Akwa Ibom State, had been nominated by his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC) to become the senate President of the 10th National Assembly.

In his tweet, Bwala said Akpabio’s bid to run for the leadership of the upper chamber is hindered by a thick, heavy cloud. Bwala wrote, “Godswill Akpabio would not be elected as Senate President. The cloud gathering against his aspiration is heavy and thick. “It is not motivated by religion, but regional and as well as the revenge of the coalition of all foes. Most of the senators following him are not with him.”
