 Muhammed Kola Balogun, the senator representing Oyo South Senatorial District, has said that attaining a democratic ideal may be a mirage without corrupt-free, vibrant and ethical media platforms. The lawmaker, who was the guest speaker at the World Press Freedom Day organised by the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) B Zone in Ibadan, at the weekend, said “Our democracy is going through a wobbling evolution. If we continue to work at it, we will get to the promised land, no matter how long it takes. “But this is not achievable without vibrant, highly professional and ethical media platforms devoid of corruption. He, however, said corruption-free media platforms could be achieved through attractive remuneration, improved welfare packages, well-founded media educational institutions and guaranteed personal security of practitioners. According to him, attractive remuneration and welfare packages were the way out. Media educational institutions must be well funded and personal security of the practitioners be guaranteed. “If media practitioners’ welfare is not a priority, journalist will cut corners and compromise the standard of objectivity,” he added He, therefore, advised the government at all levels, media owners and all stakeholders in the media industry to prioritise the welfare of journalists. At the event, the Olubadan of Ibadan land, Lekan Balogun, represented by Ekerin Olubadan of Ibadan land, maintained that journalists would compromise objectivity if their welfare was not prioritised.
