 Joe Biden, president of the United States, has said his country stands with the Nigerian people as they chart a path toward a more democratic, prosperous, and secure future. He said in a statement on Nigeria’s upcoming election seen by BusinessDay that citizens of the country deserve to choose their leader. “Elections are a fundamental part of a functioning democracy, and all Nigerians deserve this chance to choose their future freely and fairly,” Biden said. “While the United States does not support any single candidate or party, we strongly support a peaceful and transparent process that reflects the will of the people of Nigeria.” He commended Wednesday’s peace accord signed by the political parties and candidates running in the presidential election on February 25.
