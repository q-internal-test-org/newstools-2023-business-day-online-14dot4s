The market further defies analysts’ expectation of mixed performance this week. In their investment views this week, the United Capital research analysts said they expect the depressed interest rate environment to continue to favour the equities market “in line with our expectations for first-quarter (Q1) 2023.” Though they analysts noted that the profit-taking activities seen last week “serve as a caution to market participants as the bears may fully resume.” The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) is expected to release its inflation report for January 2023. “Looking ahead, the implementation of the Naira redesign policy which has been met with serious challenges like shortage of the new Naira note is a new clog in the campaign against inflation. While the CBN has made considerable progress in mopping up the old currencies, the hopes of this achieving its intended inflation moderating effect is in question for the short term,” said research analysts at Lagos-based Meristem.
