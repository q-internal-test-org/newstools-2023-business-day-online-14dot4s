 The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Wednesday issued a public apology via its Twitter handle for unintentionally liking a post criticizing one of the 18 presidential candidates. Earlier in the day, INEC liked a Premium Times report written by Afrobeat maestro Seun Kuti, in which he dismissed Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, as an opportunist and capitalist who only wants to use the goodwill of the people to exploit the country. The report titled “Peter Obi: An Opportunist, Won’t Save Nigeria—Seun Kuti” had solicited a like from INEC, a situation many had ascribed as not only being unfortunate but also favourably taking sides in an upcoming election when it should be seen as neutral.
