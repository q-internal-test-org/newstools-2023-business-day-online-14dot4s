 Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, increased its numerical strength in terms of polling unit agents following the collapse of the party structure of the Boot Party into the Labour Party. A delegation of the Boot Party’s national leadership met with delegates of the Labour Party on Tuesday to provide moral and other support to help actualize Obi’s ambition. The meeting was chaired by PA Ayo Adebanjo, the leader of Afenifere, the Yoruba Pan-Socio-cultural Group. In attendance to witness this political development was Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour, the governorship candidate of the Labour Party in Lagos State. The party, which has a strong presence in the South West, has promised to work hard to mobilise resources and efforts to deliver the South West to Obi.
