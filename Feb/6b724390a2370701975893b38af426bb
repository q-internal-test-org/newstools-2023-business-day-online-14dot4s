 No matter how much time passes, Love remains the most powerful emotion we can feel. Love not only mends broken hearts but also makes us stronger and more resilient against life’s obstacles. As we age, Love comes to our rescue in many life situations. It is said that with Love, anything is possible! Love can be like a fine wine, getting better with age. As we mature, our experience and understanding of love grows more complex and richer. Aging can also heighten our emotions, making us more alive to cherished moments of connection with others. We can love so many people throughout our lives, our parents, our siblings, our friends, spouse, children and so on. Any of these people can leave us at any time. Parents pass away, children leave home and move to other cities, friendships end. The one constant companion you will have throughout your life, well into old age, is yourself. In order to age well, you must love and accept yourself. Unfortunately, as many people get older and their bodies and circumstances change, they find it more and more difficult to love themselves. It is so easy to love others more than ourselves so don’t forget to love yourself! Self-love is so important, and we should make sure that as we age, we’re filling our hearts with the same warmth and affection that we give others.
