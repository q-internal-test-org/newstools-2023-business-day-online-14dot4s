He promised that if he became president, he was going to grow the entertainment industry by giving them the necessary support. “And he realised the fact that I am an actor, and I think part of what is holding this country back from development is releasing those engines that will develop us. One of the most critical places I want to focus is on improving our entertainment industry until it grows,” he said. “The Nollywood! And now that I am an acclaimed actor, I ask all those who are involved in the entertainment industry, myself being one of them, to support me so that I can improve their position,” he added, urging entertainment practitioners to support his ambition to become the next president come May this year.
