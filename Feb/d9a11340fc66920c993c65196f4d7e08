 Nigeria is projected to adopt a free-floating exchange rate regime post-election, according to Bismarck Rewane, managing director/chief executive officer of Financial Derivatives Company Limited. The reason is that the Federal Government is likely to borrow from the international Monetary Fund (IMF) and will have to comply with conditions including naira devaluation. In the short-term or pre-election period, Nigeria needs to adopt a crawling peg strategy, increase foreign exchange supply and reduce punitive measures. Naira on Wednesday depreciated by 0.06 percent as the dollar was quoted at N461.60 compared to N461.33 quoted at the last close of N461.50/$1 on Tuesday at the Investors and Exporters (I&E) forex window. Most currency dealers who participated at the foreign exchange auction on Tuesday maintained bids between N406.75 (low) and N462.41 (high) per dollar, data from the FMDQ indicated.

Last week at the open market, the local currency worsened in value against the United States dollar as it depreciated by N11 or 1.46 percent week on week to close at N766/USD from N755/USD in the previous week. On the other hand, at the investors’ and exporters’ FX window, the Naira appreciated by marginal 0.05 percent week on week to close at N461.25/USD from N461.50/USD despite the growing foreign exchange pressure on the naira and the newly redesigned currency circulation battle, a report by Cowry Asset Management said. He said manufacturers get only 5 percent of forex demand from the official window, while over 95 percent of the forex are sourced from the parallel market. This he attributed to fall in dollar inflows, as oil earnings, natural gas price, foreign investment and Diaspora flows decline. Foreign Direct Investment went down by 5.03 percent to $147.16 billion in the second quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of 2022.

According to Rewane, Naira adjustments will have limited impact unless accompanied by major fiscal adjustments and the underlying policy and structural issues must be addressed “The outcome of the election will determine what will happen to the exchange rate. The Dangote refinery is not ‘the silver bullet’.”
