However, any voting on the queue before 2:30 pm would be allowed to vote even if voting goes before the official closing time. No voter would be disenfranchised. “I wish all Nigerians a pleasant voting experience tomorrow. We have established a situation room here at our national collation center. Our INEC citizens’ contact centre is already up and running. Nigerians can contact us on our well-publicized social media handle live and direct on election day.”
