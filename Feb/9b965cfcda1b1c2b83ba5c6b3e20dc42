 Wizkid, Davido, Asake, and Goya Menor have been nominated for the 2023 South African Amapiano Music Awards for their contributions to the genre. The new South African genre “Amapiano” is making waves in Nigeria, and steadily making headway globally. In 2020, DJ Maphorisa and Kabza De Small released Sponono, an Amapiano track featuring Wizkid and Burna Boy. Wizkid also featured on Kabza De Smalls Need You Tonight in 2020, while in 2021, Focalistic collaborated with Davido for the remix of Ke Star, his 2020 hit. Nigerian artists have begun riding the modified Amapiano waves since its emergence, making it the in-genre currently on the Nigerian scene. According to DJ Qness, CEO of the South African Amapiano Awards “The South African Amapiano Awards are one of South Africa’s most anticipated music awards which look to celebrate the hottest Amapiano artists. As part of our mission ‘Amapiano to the world’, we will continue to push the frontiers, while showcasing the impact African music and culture is making across the world.” See the complete list of Amapiano Awards 2023 nominees below: Best Amapiano Street Dancer Chad Jones & Family Soweto’s Finest Hope Ramafalo & Hlogi Mash (House Of H&H) Kananelo & Tlhogi Thee Buhle Best Amapiano Online DJ / Performance Platform Balcony Mix – Major League DJz Black Music – Mr Jazziq Groove Cartel – Groove Cartel Mordecai – DJ Mordecai Pianocast – Stanky DeeJay Best Amapiano Artist Manager Coby for DBN Gogo Dada Archie for Amaroto Kreative Korner for Uncle Waffles Thuli for Blaqboy Music & Piano Hub Tshiamo for Musa Keys Best Amapiano Festive Hit “Ba Straata” by DJ Maphorisa & Visca feat.
