Coronation Research analysts in their February 20 note to investors said, “The first seven weeks of the year have provided equity investors with a gain on the NGX All-Share Index. As has often happened in the past, investors are faced with the question of what to do following a January rally”.

Therefore, any nervous trading over the election period may provide a buying opportunity, especially for dividend-hungry investors looking to be paid a few months from now,” the analysts said. Geregu Power, GTCO, Zenith Bank, Access Corporation and UBA were top-5 traded stocks on Tuesday as equities traders in 2,950 deals exchanged 254,174,108 shares valued at N15.577billion. “The market has rallied significantly in consecutive months, raising fears of an over-extended market. We expect sustained bullish sentiments as we anticipate downbeat money market yields till second quarter (Q2) of 2023 and a gradual decline in trading volumes in the coming days. “However, as technical indicators point to more significant downside potential for equities, we consider buying equities a ‘riskier’ rather than a ‘wrong’ strategy while favouring reducing portfolio exposures as the ideal approach. Equity stakeholders can look to book profits off stocks that have crossed the overbought region, as the RSI indicates,” said analysts at Lagos-based United Capital in their February 21 note.
