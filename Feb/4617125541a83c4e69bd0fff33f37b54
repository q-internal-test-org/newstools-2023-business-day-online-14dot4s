Therefore, we expect increased selloffs in the equities market this week. First, investors may look to take profit on stocks that have appreciated significantly in the prior weeks. “Also, we consider the election jitters and perceived political risk as contributory factors. Nonetheless, we do not rule out the possibility of investors taking position ahead of corporate earnings releases. Overall, we expect the market to close in the negative region this week,” said Meristem research analysts. “The market is expected to have a mixed performance this week, with profit-taking and large-cap stocks dictating market trends,” said Lagos-based Vetiva research analysts.
