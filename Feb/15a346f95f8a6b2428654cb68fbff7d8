 Nigeria’s equities market opened the election week on a positive note amid analysts’ expectation that investors will be more selective in their bids.

Conoil Plc led the advancers league after its share price increased from N35.25 to N38.75, adding N3.50 or 9.93percent. It was followed by Livingtrust Mortgage Bank Plc which increased from N2.30 to N2.52, adding 22kobo or 9.57percent. Other top gainers include Tripple G which rose from N1.99 to N2.18, adding 19kobo or 9.55percent and John Holt which moved up from N1.33 to N1.46, adding 13kobo or 9.77percent. The market went up by 0.78percent or N228billion at the close of trading, pushing the year-to-date (YtD) return to 5.80percent.

Going into the week, we expect an extended bearish momentum across board, with post-election worries stimulating the bear market. “We recommend that Buy-Side investors and fund managers sit on the sideline, in a bid “wait and observe” the market. Equity stakeholders can look to book profits off stocks that have crossed the overbought region as indicated by the RSI. “However, we believe that this brief bearish momentum would present further opportunities for the Buy-Side to increase holdings (in the near-term) on fundamentally sound stocks with improved valuation and dividend performance,” United Capital research analysts said in their Monday, February 20 note. On what they expect to shape the market on Tuesday, Lagos-based Vetiva analysts who noted that Monday’s market activity was dominated by the small-cap names, also said as the elections approach, they expect investors to be more selective with their bids and anticipate a mixed session on Tuesday.
