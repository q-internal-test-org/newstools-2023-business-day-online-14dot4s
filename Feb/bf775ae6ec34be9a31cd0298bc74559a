 Labour Party leads with the most polling unit agents assigned for the February 25 and March 11 elections in Nigeria but the agents are not well distributed, especially in key states. The increase in the number of agents comes after the African Democratic Congress (ADC) collapsed its structure to support the presidential ambition of Peter Obi, its presidential candidate. On the official Twitter handle of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the Labour Party had 134,874 while ADC had 96,043. As a result, the Obi-Datti campaign movement gets 230,917 agents to monitor activities at polling stations across the country on election days. Labour Party was followed by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), and the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), who will engage 176,588, 176,223, and 176,200 polling unit agents nationwide, respectively. However, a breakdown showed that despite that total lead, the party even with its collaboration with the ADC lagged behind in very important states such as Lagos, Kano, Katsina, Oyo, and Rivers State. Only in Kaduna State has the party been able to mobilise enough manpower to monitor activities at polling stations on election days. A breakdown of the table available on the INEC Twitter handle showed that we have a total of 27 National Collation Centers, with most of the parties having two except AAC, ADP, BP, NNPP, and SDP, which have one, while ZLP and APGA have none.
