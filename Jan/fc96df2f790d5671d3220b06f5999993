 Mobile money accounts are expected to grow by 39 percent of the sub-Saharan population by 2025, a global mobile money 2021 report shows.

According to her, the entrance of telcos like MTN and Airtel into the Nigerian mobile money market is a big trend for mobile money on the African continent. “Adoption of mobile money in Nigeria through MTN and Airtel will change the landscape and introduce innovative services and partnerships that will differ from what we’ve seen so far,” she said. “Nigeria is Africa’s largest unbanked population, and while its payment industry has flourished, there’s hardly any lead player banking the unbanked in a sustainable manner.

He also said that for the economy, increasing the rate of financial inclusion is assisting in meeting the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) of increasing financial inclusion to 95 percent in 2024 from 64 percent in 2020.
