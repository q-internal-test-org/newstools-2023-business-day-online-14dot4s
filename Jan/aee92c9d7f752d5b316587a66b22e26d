 The Nigerian creative industry has received a huge boost with the opening of John Rendle Centre for Yoruba Culture & History, a world-class cultural facility. The centre was commissioned today by President Muhammadu Buhari, who left afterwards to commission other projects in Lagos. Located at Onikan, Lagos, the centre emerged from the restoration of a public swimming pool built in 1928 with updated facilities, amid creating a centerpiece community building with a 1,000 square metre exhibiting gallery that tells the story of Yoruba history and culture. The centre, an architectural wonder, with the shape of a fractal, rising from the earth, leaning forward and reflecting the progressive nature of the Yorubas, is also part of an urban regeneration project at the heart of Lagos Island.
