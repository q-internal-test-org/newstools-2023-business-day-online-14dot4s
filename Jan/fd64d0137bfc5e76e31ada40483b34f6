In the campaign video, Adichie talks about feminism and femininity while presenting the House’s timeless new must-have. “I feel happiest when I am surrounded by the people I love—by my family, by my friends. I think I just light up.I think femininity and feminism have often been seen as mutually exclusive. “And so, I think for a long time, people felt that being a feminist meant somehow to reject everything to do with femininity. Right so, you have to in some ways, kind of appropriate a man to be a feminist, and I don’t think so at all. I think that femininity and feminism actually complement each other,” she said.
