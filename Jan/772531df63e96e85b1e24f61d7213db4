 The Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) has awarded AgroEknor the Best Youth Exporter of The Year. Attah Anzaku, the executive director of AgroEknor International Limited, received the award on behalf of the company during the NEPC annual gala in Lagos. “This award recognizes AgroEknor’s commendable effort to transform the domestic food systems for increased export earnings while providing access to increased income earnings and quality inputs to smallholder farmers across Nigeria,” Anzaku stated. According to Anzaku, AgroEknor was also recognized by the NEPC for its contribution to the growth of the non-oil export sector, and its consistency towards international trade while ensuring value-add to domestically sourced agriculture commodities. “We provide a straightforward access to market for agro-products which creates higher income opportunities for smallholder farmers, agro processors and also reduces food wastage in the agriculture value chain,” he stated. In 2019 AgroEknor International Limited was also recognized and celebrated by BusinessDay Nigeria as one of the top 100 SME’s in Nigeria.
