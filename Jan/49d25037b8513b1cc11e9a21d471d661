 The Cinema Exhibition Association of Nigeria has released its weekly top 20 films showing that Ryan Coogler’s Black Panther : Wakanda Forever has earned over N1 billion, the first movie to ever make that amount on Nigerian soil. The film was the first of Hollywood blockbuster film franchises to have an official African press conference and premiere earning N240 million in its opening weekend including one day advanced screening. Wakanda Forever draws inspiration from the tragic loss of its real-world loss and depicts Wakanda in a state of mourning for the loss of its king and protector. It is an epic yet heartbreaking tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman, the actor who played King T’Challa. Wakanda Forever discusses T’Challa’s prospective heirs in a future without the Black Panther while respectfully transitioning to his younger sister Shuri’s (Letitia Wright) role. It also reveals Toussaint (Divine Love Konadu-Sun) as a potential recipient of the heart-shaped plant.
