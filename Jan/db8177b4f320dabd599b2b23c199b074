The 289th meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) which had started on Monday ended on Tuesday, January 24. The MPC raised the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) by 100 basis points (bps) to 17.5percent; retained the asymmetric corridor of the MPR at +100 / -700 basis points; retained the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) at 32.5percent; and retained liquidity ratio at 30percent. “Going forward, we expect the hawkish policy decision to contribute to a slowdown in equities in the short run. Also, we expect the decision to muddy the outlook for the fixed income market. On one hand, robust system liquidity and healthy maturity inflows will raise demand for fixed income instruments. On the other hand, investors will likely begin to price in the rate hike at subsequent primary auctions. “Overall, we reckon the unexpected aggressiveness of the MPC will create a volatile fixed income market for the rest of the quarter, with the yield curve likely to record a bear flattening (short term interest rates rising faster than long term rates),” United Capital analysts said in their January 25 note.
