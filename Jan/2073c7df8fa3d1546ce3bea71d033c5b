 The tech sector has recorded the highest number of monthly layoffs in January, surpassing the figures recorded since 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic forced companies to reduce their workforce. According to Layoffs.fyi, a job cut tracking platform, 55,970 tech workers are being dismissed from their jobs across 173 companies. This massive layoff also exceeded the overall number of employees dismissed in the first 6 months of 2022 and surpassed third-quarter figures in a year that recorded an all-time high. In the first half of 2022, there were 44,257 reported layoffs in the tech sector with companies dismissing 9,829 staff in the first quarter and 34,243 in the second quarter. The overall layoff in the third quarter was 35,229, a number yet to meet the January figure. Similarly, in 2020, the highest number of employee layoff which stood at 60,141, was recorded on a quarterly basis in the second quarter of 2022. This number is not too far from the present 55,970 recorded in January despite having more days to end the month.
