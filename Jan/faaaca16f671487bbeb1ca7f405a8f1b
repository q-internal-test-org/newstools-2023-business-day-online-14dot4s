 The Zamfara Chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Monday condemned an alleged attack on APC members, government vehicles, and innocent persons by suspected thugs in Maguru village, Kaura-Namoda Local Government Area of the state. This is contained in a statement issued in Gusau by the state APC publicity secretary, Malam Yusuf Idris. Idris described what he called an “ugly” incident as disheartening and unfortunate.

Idris said that APC was a law-abiding party, saying, “We will always immediately run to security agents to seek redress, and we will not stop until justice is done to us and our members. “We are appealing to our members to remain calm as usual.” Idris said that those behind the attack would be arrested and brought to face the consequences of their actions, along with their sponsors. “We also wish to commend security operatives who ensured the return of peace in the area,” he added.
