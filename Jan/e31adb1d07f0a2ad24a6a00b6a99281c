In their January 30 market previous, Meristem research analysts said, “We expect positive sentiment to persist in the market this week as investors continue to take position on stocks that are at attractive prices.” “Also, we do not consider the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)’s decision to raise the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) by 100 basis points (bps) to 17.50percent last week as a trigger that would have much influence on the equities market this week. The market appears to have priced the rate hike expectation in beforehand. Thus, we expect the market to close in the green zone this week,” Meristem analysts said.
