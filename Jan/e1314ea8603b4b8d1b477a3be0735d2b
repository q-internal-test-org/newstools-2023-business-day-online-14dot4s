 Transparency International’s 2022 Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), has alluded to the link between corruption and violence, citing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a “stark reminder” of the threat that corruption and lack of government accountability pose to global security. According to the report released yesterday, 95 percent of countries have made little to no progress against corruption since 2017. It showed that countries with the lowest CPI scores also have the lowest Global Peace Index scores: “Global peace is deteriorating, and corruption is both a key cause and result of this.” Read also: Attack on Burkina Faso military leaves at least 28 soldiers dead On a scale from 0 (very clean) to 100 (highly corrupt), this index’s 21st edition ranks 180 nations and territories according to the perception of public sector corruption by experts.
