 Peter Obi, the Presidential Candidate of Labour Party (LP), says his administration will unite and secure Nigeria if elected on February 25. Obi said this on Thursday at a political rally held in Michael Okpara Square Enugu, capital of Enugu State. “I assure you that if elected president of Nigeria, our administration will unite and secure Nigeria,” he said. He said that one of the priorities of his government would be to recruit more youths into all security agencies. “We will put Nigerians into the security agencies, pay them well and provide them with insurance cover,” Obi said. The LP Presidential flagbearer further said that his emergence will lead to the end of disruption of academic activities in tertiary institutions in Nigeria.

Also speaking, the State Chairman of Labour Party, Casmir Agbo, said that Enugu State was 100 per cent obedient. Agbo said that in spite of efforts by the ruling party in the state to derail the LP, the party had continued to move from strength to strength. A former Governor of Anambra, Chukwuemeka Ezeife, urged the people of Enugu and the South East in general to vote Obi for equity, justice and fairness. He said that the unity of Nigeria was paramount than any other individual or group consideration.
