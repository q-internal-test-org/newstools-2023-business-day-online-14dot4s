 Nigeria’s stock market could not make remarkable upward or downward shift on Tuesday as investors failed to increase holdings on fundamentally sound stocks with improved valuation and dividend yield while the sell-side of the Bourse was also calm. The flat close on Tuesday comes amid post-election uncertainties and a depressed interest rate environment, particularly at the short end of the curve. “As we wrote in our year-ahead outlook, Nigerian general elections tend to be inflection points for Nigeria’s financial markets. What does the victory of the All Progressives Congress in last week’s presidential elections imply? The APC’s election manifesto calls for growth, and growth is to be provided by a high level of public expenditure,” said analysts at Coronation Research in their March 7 note to investors.
