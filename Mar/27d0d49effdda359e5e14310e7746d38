Political instability can lead to economic uncertainty, which can negatively impact the real estate market. Therefore, it is essential for real estate investors to conduct due diligence before making investment decisions, especially during times of political uncertainty. Due diligence is the process of investigating and analysing a potential investment opportunity before making a decision. It involves gathering and reviewing relevant information, assessing the risks and benefits of the investment, and evaluating the viability of the investment. Due diligence is crucial in real estate investment because it helps investors to make informed decisions that can lead to profitable outcomes. Economic and Political Climate: Economic and political conditions can have a significant impact on the real estate market. During times of political uncertainty, it is essential to conduct due diligence on the economic and political climate of the region where the investment opportunity is located. Legal and Regulatory Framework: The legal and regulatory framework in a country can affect the real estate market. It is essential to conduct due diligence on the legal and regulatory framework to identify potential legal and regulatory risks that may impact the investment opportunity. For instance, in South Africa, changes in land expropriation laws have raised concerns among real estate investors, causing uncertainty in the market.
