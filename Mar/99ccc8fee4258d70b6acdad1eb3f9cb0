 The Muslim Media Practitioners of Nigeria (MMPN) Oyo State Chapter has asked the Nigerian President-Elect, Ahmed Bola Tinubu not only to be steadfast in his resolve to prioritise competence, merit and integrity in running state affairs but should equally make his administration inclusive of women, religious leaders, youths and people with disabilities. The group in a communique issued at the end of its monthly meeting held in Ibadan, and signed by the Chairman, Adebayo Abdur-Rofih also pointed out the need for the incoming government to fashion out modalities of entrenching true federalism with a view to addressing most of the nation’s ethnic, social and economic questions.

While cautioning political actors whose parties and candidates lost in the general elections to resist any attempt at constituting a clog in the wheel of the nation’s democratic existence and progress, Oyo MMPN enjoined them to toe the constitutionally approved procedures to present their grievances and seek redress. The MMPN in Oyo state also charged the National Population Commission to embark on adequate and result-oriented planning that would guarantee accurate and acceptable population and housing census in order to have reliable data for national planning and resource management.
