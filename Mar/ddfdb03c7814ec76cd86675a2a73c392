According to Meristem research analysts, “We anticipate a further rate hike by the Monetary Policy Committee this week. While we do not anticipate a substantial reaction from investors, this is expected to prompt further selloffs. However, we do not rule out bargain-hunting activities on some tickers that have depreciated. “Overall, we expect the market to close in the negative this week,” they added. Earlier in their note, Meristem research analysts noted that, “In recent weeks, the Nigerian equities market has been relatively negative, evinced by lower market turnover and a significant number of laggards. Thus, the prevailing negative sentiment is expected to linger this week as investors take profit from tickers that have appreciated, especially in the financial services sector (a probable spill-over effect from the global economy).”
