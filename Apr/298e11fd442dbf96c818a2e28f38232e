He had accused ministers of treating their employees differently than others in the public sector after negotiations were held with unions representing health workers and teachers. The union is stepping up strikes, with a nationwide walkout of more than 130,000 civil servants planned for April 28. The Home Office said the passport office had already processed more than 2.7 million applications this year. It added that over 99.7 per cent of standard applications were being processed within 10 weeks, with the majority of those delivered to customers well under this timescale. However, there are currently no plans to change official guidance which states that it takes up to 10 weeks to get a passport.
