Also, we envisage bargain hunting activities from investors across sectors. Nonetheless, we do not rule out profit-taking activities on some tickers that have appreciated. Overall, we expect the market to close in the positive this week”. In their view, Vetiva analysts anticipated a mixed start to week to trading in the equities market, “as investors wrap up their portfolio rebalancing activities”. “The Central Bank of Nigeria’s naira redesign policy, the amount of currency in circulation in the nation decreased by 29.16percent month-on-month (m/m), from N1.4 trillion in January 2023 to N900billion in February 2023. Despite the intended objective of moderating inflation, inflation ticked up in February. “The cash crunch had a countervailing effect on economic activities amid numerous digital transaction failures, restricted access to cash in rural areas, and the crippling of the informal sector. While high base effects could momentarily ease inflation, the suppression of demand may not tame inflationary pressures over the medium term, as inflation in Nigeria is primarily cost-push,” the noted. Also, United Capital research analysts said, “Looking ahead, we expect risk-on sentiments to be sustained in the equities markets. The choice strategy is to take positions in stocks with attractive pricings, solid valuations and dividend yields ahead of the dividend-paying season”.
