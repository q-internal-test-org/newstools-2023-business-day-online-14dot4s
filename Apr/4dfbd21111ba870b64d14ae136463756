 One of Labour Party’s support group, The Obi-Datti Movement, has said OBIdients and the party’s vice presidential candidate, Datti Baba-Ahmed are ready for the TV debate challenge called by the Nobel laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka. It was earlier reported that the renowned playwright recently challenged Obi’s running mate to an open debate following his claims on the 2023 general elections. Speaking on Arise TV Saturday, the mouthpiece of the Obi-Datti Movement, Chris Nwakobia dared Soyinka to come out for the TV debate.
