The platform reported that demand for the exclusive app has been growing, as it currently has about 20,000 users in its current form. Also, the app developers, along the line hope to give algorithmic choice to users which would enable them to choose how content is fed onto their screens, instead of a one-fits-all algorithm controlled by the app developers. Meanwhile, Musk acquired the Dorsey’s Twitter in October 2022, after completing his $44 billion deal.
