 United States President Joe Biden on Tuesday formally announced that he is running for reelection in the 2024 presidential elections. Biden posted a video asking voters to give him more time to finish the job he started when took office.

According to reports, in recent weeks, his approval ratings stood at just 39 per cent in a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on April 19.
