Nobody will accept this. I trust my northern people. “I trust Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq and other All Progressives governors that led the campaign for power to shift to the South will be pleased that the country is one despite the contrary permutations from some quarters. “The northern governors when they spoke for power to shift to the South did so bearing in mind the troubles and expectations of Nigerians. The decision was predicated on good intentions. Everybody fell in love with that decision. “The president-elect, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu won the February 25, 2023 election in 30 out of the 36 states of the the federation and most of the votes were even got from the north. It is even very surprising that anybody would contest election and win in other regions order than his own to that extent. “Nigerians have spoken and we have spoken loudly. It will be so sad for anybody now to say that President-elect Asiwaju Bola Tinubu should not be sworn-in.”
