 Twitter, an online social media platform, has partnered with eToro, an investment platform to provide users with access to stocks, cryptocurrencies, and other financial assets in real time. Introduced in December by the social media platform, this feature shows current prices for cryptocurrencies, stocks, and other assets to Twitter users searching for Cashtags like $TSLA or $BTC and points them to the eToro platform to invest. In a tweet announcing the feature, eToro said that users will be able to see the real-time prices for a “much wider range of stocks, crypto, and other assets.” Yoni Assia, the CEO of eToro, said that his company has observed that many of its users are using Twitter to discuss various financial markets.
