Subsequently, investors may favour the fixed-income market over the equities market. “However, the low prices and valuations provide an opportunity for Buy-side to re-enter the market and take positions ahead of the first quarter (Q1) 2023 earnings season,” said analysts at Lagos-based United Capital research. Also, Meristem research analysts who noted in their April 11 commentary that for three consecutive weeks, the performance in the market has been relatively bearish, further noted that activity levels have been somewhat
lower despite earnings releases and dividend announcements. “We opine that there are limited positive triggers that could spur buying activities from investors. In addition, the tight system liquidity ahead of the NTbills auction this week is likely to cause
flow of funds from the equities market. “Notwithstanding, we do not rule out bargain hunting activities on tickers that present attractive dividend yield and capital
appreciation opportunities. Overall, we expect the market to close in the negative region
this week,” Meristem research analysts added.
