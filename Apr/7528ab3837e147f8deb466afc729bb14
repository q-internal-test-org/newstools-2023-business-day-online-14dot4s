 Wole Soyinka, noble laureate, has faulted the conduct of the 2023 general election. In an interview with Channels Television’s Roadmap 2023, which was aired on Monday night, the author said the polls were “not exactly the most edifying exercise that we’ve been through.” He revealed that although he had been out of the country for some months, the news he met on his return were “horrendous” and unpleasant. According to Soyinka, “On arriving, I came in for the World Poetry Day, and immediately, I was bombarded by the most horrendous narratives both pre and after the elections. “Since then, I’ve also read columns; I’ve seen Nigerian papers for the first time in months and I didn’t like what I read at all. “My trust has broken down completely and even the minimum restraint that we’ve learnt to expect from seasoned politicians have been jettisoned completely.” The conduct of the 2023 general election by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) have been criticized by large spectrum of Nigerians and international observers.
