 Farooq Kperogi, a media scholar said on Saturday that the presidential candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) Rabiu Kwankwaso, did not contest the 2023 election because he wanted to win. Writing in his weekly column, Kperogi said the former Kano State governor only wanted to leverage his presidential run to help his son-in-law get elected as governor of Kano State. The US-based Professor was referring to Abba Kabir Yusuf, the governor-elect of Kano State.

That’s a classic instantiation of a local champion,” Kperogi wrote
