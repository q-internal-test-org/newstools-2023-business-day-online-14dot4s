 Despite agonies reported by farmers in different parts of the country while the cash shortages persisted, Nigeria’s agric export surged 39 percent in the first quarter of 2023, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The exported agro-products were worth N279.64 billion in the first three months of the year as against N201.59 billion recorded in the corresponding period of 2022. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, the country’s export grew 63.9 percent compared to N170.59 billion worth of exports in the previous quarter (Q4 2022). According to the report, the sector accounted for 4.3 percent of the country’s total export (N6,487.04 billion) for the period. The cash crunch that engulfed the entire nation in the first quarter caused the sector to contract for the first time in the democratic era. NBS attributed the reduction in growth to the adverse effects of the cash crunch experienced during the quarter.
