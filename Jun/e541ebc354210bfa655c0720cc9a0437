 Boundaries are an important part of relationships but I have noticed that many do not set this boundaries from the start of their relationships due to fear of losing their partner. If you are in a relationship and you can hardly set the standards of what you want and be firm with it, then you may be probably idolising the relationship. What does it mean to set boundaries? It simply means to set a limit as to how things will be done and what you can permit or not. Setting boundaries is a form of self-care that we use to manage our expectations and relationship appropriately. For you to set boundaries in your relationship, you need to be clear about what you want and what you cannot tolerate in a relationship. Decide and understand your own personal boundaries. It is important for you to be self-aware about what you want. Do you dislike being called certain names? Do you dislike being touched in a particular way? Or maybe you do not like people tampering with your personal belongings without permission? You also may like to speak without disrespect and expect such things too. Do a proper evaluation of yourself, determine your boundaries and make sure you are not guilty of breaking such too. Setting boundaries can be in the area of physical contact, words, touch, your personal space and your personal life.
