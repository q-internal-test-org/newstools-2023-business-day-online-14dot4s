 Nigeria’s stock market jumped to its highest level since July 2008 Tuesday as investors interpreted the suspension of CBN governor Godwin Emefiele last Friday as the end of unorthodox monetary policies that have spooked foreign investments. The market rose 4 percent to above 58,163 points, according to Bloomberg data, taking the year to date return of the market to 11.8 percent, almost double the 6 percent return on the MSCI index. Meanwhile, Nigerian Eurobonds were roughly flat on the day after an initial surge Monday in reaction to Emefiele’s suspension.
