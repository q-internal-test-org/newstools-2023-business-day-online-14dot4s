The development means buyers and sellers of foreign currency in the official FX market are now allowed to quote rates they find comfortable in the FX market, as against previous practice where rates were dictated by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). Olisa Agbakoba, Nigerian human rights activist, maritime lawyer and former President of Nigerian Bar Association, said naira float is great news. “For me, removing all the checkpoints of CBN dollar control and the street dollar control is brilliant news,” he said. He said if the FX flows more efficiently there would be a slight rise in inflation and that Nigerians should prepare for difficult moments in the next two to three months after which there will be normalcy.
