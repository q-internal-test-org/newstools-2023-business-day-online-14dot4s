 Godswill Akpabio’s ascent in Nigerian politics culminated in his election Tuesday as the Senate President for the 10th National Assembly, defeating Abdul’aziz Yari with 63 votes against 46 votes. Born on December 9, 1962, in Ukana Ikot Ntuen, Akwa Ibom State, Akpabio began his journey from humble beginnings to a prominent figure in Nigerian politics. He attended Methodist Primary School in Ukana and later pursued a law degree at the University of Calabar after completing his secondary education at the Federal Government College in Port Harcourt. After graduating and being called to the Nigerian Bar, Akpabio briefly worked as a teacher before embarking on a legal career. He became an associate partner at a law firm and eventually rose to the position of CEO at EMIS Telecoms Limited, a telecommunications company in Lagos. Akpabio’s entry into politics began with his appointment as Commissioner for Special Duties and Petroleum Resources in Akwa Ibom State. His dedication to public service propelled him to contest for the governorship seat in 2007, winning the election and serving two terms until 2015. During his tenure, Akwa Ibom State experienced significant development across various sectors, including infrastructure, education, healthcare, and agriculture. Following his tenure as governor, Akpabio successfully transitioned to the role of Senator representing Akwa Ibom North-West Senatorial District from 2015 to 2019. He actively contributed to legislative debates and policy formulations during his time as a senator. After his resignation from the Senate, Akpabio was appointed as the Minister for Niger Delta Affairs by former President Muhammadu Buhari. However, he later resigned to pursue the APC’s presidential primary ticket, which ultimately went to President Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Undeterred, Akpabio returned to the Senate and successfully won the senatorial election in February after some legal battles. Determined to reach the highest echelons of the red chamber, he rallied support for the position of Senate President, resulting in his recent election victory. As the newly elected 10th President of the Senate, Akpabio holds a pivotal role in shaping Nigeria’s legislative agenda and driving the nation toward progress. With his wealth of experience, astute leadership, and unwavering commitment to the welfare of Nigerians, Akpabio is poised to leave a lasting impact in the Senate.
