 The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has urged Nigerians to disregard the purported list of designated lawmakers for the minority leadership positions of the 10th National Assembly. The PDP said this in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, in Abuja on Monday. “The PDP’s attention has been drawn to rumours and reports making the rounds, purporting that certain individuals have been designated for minority leadership positions ahead of Tuesday’s inauguration of the 10th National Assembly.

He said that at the right time, the PDP, together with its members in the National Assembly, would speak with one voice on issues with regard to other leadership positions in the federal legislature.
