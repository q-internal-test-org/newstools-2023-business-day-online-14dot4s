 Nigeria’s equities market on Wednesday rerouted south, recording its second decline this week after last Monday’s dip, as investors revisit their wait-and-see approach to stocks. President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s inaugural address on May 29 had sparked the equity market’s imagination and activated the buy-side activities on the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX). “The announcement of key market reforms, including phasing out fuel subsidies and unifying foreign exchange (FX) rates, shows that pro-market policies were not just items in the manifesto but issues which he is setting out to fix. If they are fixed, we expect much more from the equity market,” analysts at Lagos-based Coronation research had said.
