This marked the beginning of his journey towards revolutionising the access and utilisation of technology in the country’s remote areas. Mmobuosi’s visionary drive continued to unfold as he founded Tingo Inc. in 2015, successfully taking the company public on the OTC Markets Group, signaling its growth and potential in the business landscape. Adding yet another feather to his cap, Mmobuosi introduced Nwassa in January 2019, Africa’s pioneering agricultural technology and digital platform, revolutionising the continent’s agri-marketplace with its innovative approach. In February 2023, it was reported that Mmobuosi was close to completing a £90 million takeover of the newly promoted English football club Sheffield United. Fraudulent allegations Mmobuosi now finds himself entangled in a web of deceit as a recent news report exposes a series of alleged fraudulent activities. The investigation reveals that Mmobuosi made false claims, including the development of Nigeria’s first mobile payment app, which have now been debunked. Moreover, his assertion of obtaining a PhD from Universiti Putra Malaysia in rural advancement has been refuted by the university’s verification system, failing to find his name. The report also uncovers instances where Mmobuosi posted images of airplanes belonging to other airlines, masquerading as his own fleet for the purported launch of “Tingo Airlines” in 2019. It has since been revealed that he never owned any actual aircraft. Additionally, Mmobuosi’s audacious scheme involved an attempted acquisition of Sheffield United, a Premier League soccer team, alongside ambitious plans to raise $500 million and list Tingo Group on the NYSE, garnering international media attention. As a result of the exposé, Block & Leviton, a prominent law firm known for suing Elon Musk, has initiated an investigation into potential violations of securities law. The revelations have cast a shadow on Mmobuosi’s previously celebrated image as a trailblazing African tech entrepreneur, attracting cover features in Forbes Africa and GQ South Africa.
