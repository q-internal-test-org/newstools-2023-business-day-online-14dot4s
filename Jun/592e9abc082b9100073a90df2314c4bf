 Nigerian Grammy Award-winning artist Burna Boy has released a new single titled “Sitting On Top Of The World,” which is making waves among music lovers both locally and internationally. The song, which has been described as a fusion of Afrobeat, and pop sounds, has been drawing comparisons to Brandy’s hit 1998 song ‘Top of the World’. Interestingly, this is not the first time Burna Boy has drawn inspiration from pop legends to create a hit song. In May 2022 he released ‘Last Last’ which became the lead song of his sixth studio album ‘Love, Damini’. The song samples American singer Toni Braxton’s 2000 single, ‘He Wasn’t Man Enough’, for which its writers LaShawn Daniels, Harvey Mason Jr., and brothers Fred Jerkins III and Darkchild are credited on the song. Sampling songs from pop legends have proven beneficial to Burna Boy as he claimed in 2022 that the song was his most commercially successful single yet topping international song charts and being certified platinum in 5 different countries.
