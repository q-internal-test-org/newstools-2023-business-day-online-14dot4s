 Saudi Arabia’s new Riyadh Air has unveiled its first livery. The first of two expected designs, the airline called it a “perfect blend of cutting-edge technology and timeless elegance.” Riyadh Air painted the scheme on a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, of which it has ordered up to 72. According to Airways Magazine, Riyadh Air’s is one of the few liveries that is not painted on a white background. Many airlines use such white bases to reflect light off of the aircraft to prevent it from overheating.

Riyadh Air uses a purple background, perhaps closest to Australia’s Bonza or the United States’ Southwest, on its aircraft’s fuselage. The deep purple tapers to a lighter shade on the tail. The airline’s name is painted in both English and Arabic. The Dreamliner that was painted, which uses registration N8572C, was previously painted in China Southern Airlines’ livery, according to data from FlightRadar24. This registration is likely dedicated to factory planes, as it has been used on other Dreamliners undergoing testing.
